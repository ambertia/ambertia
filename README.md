## About Me

My name is Amber Barnes, and I'm currently looking for roles in software engineering. I've been technically inclined for a long time, and I have an extensive backgrounds with both mechanical engineering and computer science.

I previously attended Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, FL, where I sought a BSc in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I completed 128 credit-hours between August 2018 and December 2021 with a 3.44 GPA, but unfortunately external life circumstances made it impractical and illogical to stay enrolled in university after 2021. Nonetheless, my experience at university has provided me with an extensive background in not only the pure quantitative aspects of mechanical engineering, but also with the engineering design process, working in teams with others to accomplish engineering tasks, and technical writing / communication. My learning at university also provided me with my entry into the world of computer science, where I took multiple courses including Algorithms & Data Structures working in Java.

Over the recent years I've aimed to steadily ramp up my skillset and work on projects that can display my skills at solving software design challenges. I've recently reached a point of maturity in my skillset where my expertise with using different programming languages, using different tools, and solving different kinds of problems has given me the confidence that I can excel in a wide variety of software engineering roles in the right environment.

### Engineering Tools

Before I considered myself a software engineer, I considered myself a mechanical engineer. My time at university exposed me to many software tools to cover all aspects of the engineering design process, even less flashy ones.

## My Systems

Though I had dabbled before, I finally started using Linux as a daily driver when I built my current desktop PC, "Prism", in Feb 2023. I installed Garuda Linux at the time, though I've recently (Nov 2024) switched over to CachyOS. Both are Arch-based distros that have a few extra tools built on top out-of-the-box; I like the customizability and granularity of Arch, but for my desktop that I use for gaming, I like to have a distro that has some stuff set up for me.

In May 2024, I replaced my ASUS laptop with a Framework 13. Framework really impressed me with their packaging, presentation, and customizability - Very minimal plastic but robust packaging. I had to do a little bit of assembly, since I bought the R5 version but upgraded the RAM to 16GB, didn't want to pay for preinstalled Windows 11, and used an M.2 drive I already had - A Windows 10 installation that I had used maybe 10 times which was sitting collecting dust in my desktop PC. My laptop runs on a highly customized Arch Linux installation, and I have [an extensive set of dotfiles](https://github.com/ambertia/.dotfiles) for the configuration and features that are a constant work-in-progress.

I appreciate Framework's attitude as a company, focusing on repairability of their products and minimizing the plastic used in their packaging materials. I recently (Nov 2024) sat on my laptop on accident and broke the screen, but rather than deal with a complicated repair service or just outright irreparability of the device, I bought a new display module from their website for $160 and was able to replace it myself in less than half an hour by following their publicly available instructions.

I would generally consider myself a Linux nerd and open-source software enthusiast. I appreciate every day the ability to do most of my work on software that is "free as in freedom", as the saying goes, and it's immensely inspiring to me just how far the Linux ecosystem has come and just how much you can do with it. Every feature that is added to free-and-open-source softwares is a feature that doesn't serve to motivate people to use proprietary alternatives from entities that do not respect the security, privacy, or fundamentally even the agency of their consumers.
